## Welcome!

Here, you'll find information regarding **face tracking**, **asset development**, and **world development**. I'll hopefully be updating this a lot more as time goes on, but right now, focus is geared towards documenting existing information!

## [Face Tracking](https://hantnor.github.io/HanDocs/docs/category/face-tracking)
This site will serve as a reference point for troubleshooting, and is a simplified, streamlined version of Benacle's Face Tracking Docs, found [here](https://docs.vrcft.io/). If you need some documentation that's more simplified, and that focuses primarily on **basic avatar setup**, you've come to the right place! 

I encourage you to explore [this](https://docs.vrcft.io/) amazing site too! It's very informational.

## [Han's Retreat](https://hantnor.github.io/HanDocs/docs/category/hans-retreat)
The wonderous, mystical world of the Retreat. Any major updates to the world and its subsequent avatars will be documented here.
