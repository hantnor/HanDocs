# Quest Pro Setup

*Disclaimer - I am not affiliated with Meta, Facebook, or any related companies. I merely just enjoy the product!*

## A Pocket Guide!

Hi! You're probably here because you are curious about the Quest Pro, or already own one but don't know where to start. (I probably sent you here!) 

You're in the right place, because I will explain everything about my personal setup, and how you can have the highest fidelity tracking out there. I'll make this short n' sweet (with a lot of links), so let's get started!

## 1. Connection Method

If you are coming from a standalone solution, **you do need to be connected to a computer in order to use full-face tracking**. There are two categories for how a Quest headset (2, 3, **Pro**) can connect to a computer - **Tethered** and **Untethered**. 

### Tethered

Tethered refers to having a cable connecting your headset directly to your computer. This is more than familiar for those coming from most SteamVR headsets (eg. Index, Vive). This is a preferrable method for those that **do not have good Wi-Fi capabilities**. You will have to keep your cable plugged in at all times. 

Pursue connection methods like [**Oculus Link***](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/hardware/quest-pro#oculus-linkairlink-setup) if you'd like to get started.

> *Existing modules may not support **tongue tracking**. 

### Untethered

Untethered refers to being completely **wireless** from your computer as you play. This is famiiar for standalone VR users (Quest 2, 3, Pico). This is preferrable **if you like freedom of movement, and you have a stable Wi-Fi connection**. Make sure you have an external source of power to charge your headset if you are going to play for more than **two hours**.

Pursue connection methods like [**Virtual Desktop**](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/hardware/quest-pro#virtual-desktop-setup), [**AirLink***](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/hardware/quest-pro#oculus-linkairlink-setup), or [**Steam Link**](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/hardware/quest-pro#steamlink-setup) if you'd like to get started.

> *Existing modules may not support **tongue tracking**. 

## 2. Space Calibrator

*Oh no, where are my trackers?!*

If you are using **Full Body Tracking**, you may notice your trackers do not properly align in your space. This is because Steam and Oculus use different methods to track movement in space. SteamVR devices like **lighthouse trackers** and **Valve Knuckles controllers** use base stations. The Quest Pro (and 2, 3) use **inside-out** camera tracking, and therefore need to be aligned. This is all done through the **OpenVR Space Calibrator**! 

A full guide on first-time setup can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBZwX3iwaMY&t=24s). *(The guide uses a Quest 2, but the process is identical!)*

## 3. Index Controllers

*This is possible?!*

For those of you with the now 5-year-old Valve Index, be fortunate! You can use finger tracking alongside face tracking. For those that do not yet own these controllers, they can be found on Steam's website [here](https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex).

**As a very important note**, remember to buy **two extra SteamVR dongles**! They can be found for a great price [here](https://www.eozvr.com/products/steamvr-dongle). Make sure to spead the dongles apart, interference may be more common!

If you'd like to use these controllers in place of the Quest Pro's controllers, I'd recommend **unpairing the QP's controllers** after setup and use. (Note: To go through menus, your cursor will become the volume rocker!). For Space Calibrator, use the controller on top of your head. If this is too much, you can temporarily use your QP controller to calibrate, or you can pursue [**Continuous Space Calibration**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYvEb0DP4uo).
