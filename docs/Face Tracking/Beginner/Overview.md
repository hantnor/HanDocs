Most solutions to adding face tracking to avatars usually involves contacting the creator of the edits and showing proof-of-purchase to gain access. In return, you'll either get your hands on a Unity package, or merely an FBX file to transfer all of your assets to.

In others, you may run into a Unity package with a premade patcher that runs through a batch file. The naming and the location of the original FBX needs to be exact, otherwise it will not work. 

With this new solution, it will solve **all** of this!

### How does this work?

An in-Unity editor window appears when you first import the package, and it's a one-click solution to adding face tracking to any avatar!*
