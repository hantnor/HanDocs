# FAQ

- Q: What headset do you use for FT? How can I do it?
  - A: I use the **Quest Pro**! Since I've personally helped over 20 people wit their headsets (phew), I wrote a guide [here](https://hantnor.github.io/HanDocs/docs/Face%20Tracking/Beginner/Quest%20Pro%20Setup)!

- Q: An error occured in my patcher. How do I fix this?
  - A: Visit [Troubleshooting](https://hantnor.github.io/HanDocs/docs/Face%20Tracking/Troubleshooting). If you don't find your solution there, make a support ticket in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/hantnor) server!

- Q: Can I commission you for a specific model to add FT to?
  - A: Yes! You will have to cover for a copy of ownership of the preferred model and I'll give you a quote. [Contact](https://hantnor.com) me if you're interested. :) (**Note**: I may be a *little* picky!)

- Q: I made a model, and I'd like to include your FT work as part of the base package. Can I do this?
  - A: Yes, and commercial rates do apply. [Contact](https://hantnor.com) me for details!

- Q: I have a modified FBX I'd like to add face tracking to. Is this possible?
  - A: Yes, but it requires some **Blender** experience. You may find value in addons like [**Mesh Data Transfer**](https://mmemoli.gumroad.com/l/tOKEh) to ease this process along!

- Q: I have another version of FT on my avatar already, but I'd like to update it. How can I do this easily?
  - A: Usually, the regular Non-FT FBX would be repatched. If you'd prefer to have a direct patch from an older version to a newer one, contact me and we could work something out!

- Q: I'd like to learn how to make my own face tracking. How can I do this?
  - A: Tutorials like [these](https://youtu.be/MmfohWpL_SQ?si=ZJgJ3aS_9BCSGDhy) have been very helpful for me in the past!
