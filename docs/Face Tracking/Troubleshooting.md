## Oh no, something is broken!

Let's make sure that there isn't an error on your end. If not, you can create a support ticket in my server.

### DiffSize Error

<hr/>
If you get this error, you may have an out-of-date FBX file. Verify you have the latest version by comparing your version with the original seller's latest version.

If they match, make sure your FBX is **unedited**.

If your FBX is the proper one, and the patch still fails, make a support ticket here, and mention you got a **DiffSize** error. 

### Unable to find Jerry's Template

<hr/>
If you can't progress onto this stage, you may be forgetting to grab **Adjerry's Face Tracking Templates**. These are crucial for most patchers to work!

### Cannot see FT working in-game

<hr/>
You may have to reset your **VRChat OSC Cache**. More info here.
