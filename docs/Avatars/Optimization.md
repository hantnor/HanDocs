## Optimization Guide
This is the workflow I take to ensure an optimized avatar nearly every time. From textures, to meshes, to FX layers, this is the one-stop shop for optimization down to the most foundational levels!

*Below sections to be separated to their own pages*

### Textures

Textures are an essential part of what makes or breaks an avatar. They can be realistic, toony, or somewhere in between.

### Meshes

(Info about manual decimation, Polytool, mesh compression)

### FX Layers

(Info about sorting, WD, etc)
